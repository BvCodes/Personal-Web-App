## Overview

https://brettvankeppel.com

This is a personal/portfolio site. I challenged myself to build it in a day. It has little blurbs about the sites I've made, my resume, and how to contact me.

## Notable Functions

This is a really simple site so I didn't need to write much JavaScript.

- opacityHide() - This function is used to toggle the nav/sidebar. The burger button changes to an x when being toggled.
					Uses classList to switch between two different states of opacity, giving some flavor to the transition.
